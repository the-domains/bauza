## Brand hijacking 

## 

## This is not a new concept in terms of marketing philosophy, yet social media has made it more relevant than ever. Books, essays and blog entries have been written about the subject for many years. "Brand Hijacking, marketing without marketing" was published in 2005\. Its author, Alex Wipperfurth, is described as "a subversive who you should hire if you want to make your brand cool". Not a bad job description.
In essence, brand hijacking is described as a process of allowing customers to shape brand meaning and drive a brand's evolution.
As a consumer, if you like a brand, you will adopt it and try to convince others to use it. Creating the buzz and the culture is the basis of this hijacking. This is what effective marketing and brand adoption looks like in the present and is a clear path to success in the future.
The audience has grown cynical. Many have been raised with a full view of the inner workings of ad agencies and it seems like everyone now has a backstage pass to our marketing show. Many of the magician's tricks, have been figured out. Wipperfurth asks, "How do you market to an audience that rejects marketing? Consumers are pleading with advertisers to tone down the relentless yammering; and saying that we are talking too loud for them to listen." From that concern, brand hijacking is born, where in some way the market becomes the medium AND the message. What we do as a brand or as ad agency is become facilitators of the message by supplying material and content. Consumers supply the context.
Social platforms have become the perfect partner for brand hijackers since it is the unfiltered ground where conversations occur between brands and consumers. It is also a place where consumers create and curate their own content. Social platforms bring forth conversations vouching for or casting a shadow over brands. These brand ambassadors are the ones taking the picture with Medalla beer in hand and tagging the brand's accounts and are also the ones generating video content that Coca-Cola uses in its new approach to their corporate website, called Coca-Cola Journey. On the other hand, they are the ones trolling what they consider to be sub-par service brands and constantly raining on parades of brands that post content which the consumers find conflicting with their opinions and feelings toward that brand. Real time marketing has brought this issue front and center. Just be advised that regarding social as a ground for brand hijacking, for every beautiful Oreo story there is a difficult Urban Outfitter situation. Proceed with caution and with the right resources to deal with the speed of social.
Brand hijacking is a true redefinition of structure and purpose within a brand's marketing team. Our marketing brains need rewiring in order to reach these rewired markets. When was the last time you had a meeting regarding your brand's online reputation management or tracked your brand buzz?
